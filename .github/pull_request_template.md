# Pull Request

<!--
  PR title rule for squash merges: use the exact commitlint/commitizen format
  for the PR title so the squash commit can be reused unchanged.
  Pattern: `type: \#123 short description`
  Examples:
  - `docs: \#12 add bootstrap skill guide`
  - `chore: \#34 bootstrap commit hooks`
  This title rule applies to pull requests only. GitHub issue titles should stay
  plain-language and should not use conventional-commit prefixes.

  Do not put an `@` immediately before agent names such as Claude or Codex
  anywhere in the PR body unless you intentionally want to trigger that agent in
  a supported GitHub surface.

## Linked issue

- At least one GitHub closing keyword is required for normal PRs:
  `Closes #<issue>`, `Fixes #<issue>`, or `Resolves #<issue>`.
- Add one closing-keyword line for each issue this PR completes.
- `Related to #<issue>` / `Blocks #<issue>` / `Partially satisfies #<issue>`
  are additional references, not replacements for the required closing keyword.
  Include a short explanation when the relationship is not obvious.

## What changed

Context: <prior PR, prior QA pass, follow-up issue, or `standalone - <reason>`>

- <change> - <why>

<!--
  The rendered `Context:` line and `- <change> - <why>` bullet shape are the
  structural placeholders this section requires. Replace `<...>` with actual
  values; do not delete the `Context:` line. When this PR has no prior
  context, write `Context: standalone - <reason>` (e.g.
  `Context: standalone - first pass on the new lint rule`). One bullet per
  change; the `- <why>` half states the rationale (user-visible reason or
  triggering observation), not a restatement of the change.

  Include this section only when PR-level operator steps that do not belong to
  testing steps or pending CI must happen after review and before merge:

  ## Do before merging

  - [ ] Rotate the production secret after deploy.

  Keep checklist items concrete, actionable, and imperative. Do not duplicate
  testing steps or failing/pending PR checks here; PR check status is already
  reported by GitHub. Do not add this section for filler or placeholder rows.
-->

<!--
  Optional: include this whole section only when human-owned behavior or artifact
  verification is needed. Delete the full commented example when there is no
  human-owned verification decision; do not leave a placeholder row.

## Testing steps

  Include only human-owned actions or inspections. Use unchecked checkboxes
  for pass/fail verification decisions or outcomes. Prefer app behavior or reviewable artifacts:
  routes, screens, forms, buttons, filters, visual states,
  permissions, saved data, workflows, rendered docs, generated files, install
  behavior, release notes, or templates.

  GitHub Checks are the source of truth for routine automated verification.
  Do not paste successful lint, test, type-check, hook, package, or similar
  command results into the PR body. A command-based manual testing exception
  belongs here only when no realistic app or artifact review path exists; the
  command exception must name the behavior or repository contract it verifies.

- [ ] Verify <observable outcome> after <minimal action context>.
