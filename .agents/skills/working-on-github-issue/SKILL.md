# Working On GitHub Issue

## Quick Start

Invoke with an optional issue reference; run it whenever you start or resume work:

```text
/working-on-github-issue #123
/working-on-github-issue            # resolve the issue from the current branch
```

This is the shared **align** step: resolve which issue you are working, then make
GitHub reflect that — land on the issue-linked branch and mark it started. It is
**idempotent** and **best-effort**, so a controller can call it unconditionally
every run: re-running while already aligned is a no-op, and it never blocks the
caller.

It is a mechanical aligner. It does not judge scope actionability, edit the issue
body, build, review, or open a pull request — the controller that calls it owns
those decisions.

## Required Child Skill

- `new-branch`: issue-linked branch setup.

If `new-branch` is missing, halt and report the install guidance:

```sh
npm_config_ignore_scripts=true npx skills@latest add patinaproject/skills --skill new-branch -y
```

## Resolve the issue (best-effort)

Resolve exactly one issue to align, in order:

1. **Explicit reference.** If the caller supplies a bare issue number,
   `#<number>`, or same-repository GitHub issue URL, use it.
2. **Current branch.** Otherwise infer the issue from the current branch when its
   name encodes an issue number per the `<issue>-<slug>` convention `new-branch`
   produces.
3. **None.** Otherwise there is no issue to align. Report `no-issue` and return
   — do not reject, do not halt. The caller decides whether to warn and continue.

Resolution is best-effort **association**, not input gatekeeping. Reject only a
genuinely unusable *explicit* reference: multiple references, or a
cross-repository URL. Resolve through the current working directory's default
`gh` repository.

## Align (best-effort, idempotent)

When an issue resolves, align GitHub state. Branch, self-assignment, and Project
status are independent best-effort actions; none blocks the others or the caller,
and none causes a halt. When no issue resolves, skip this section entirely.

### Branch

Verify the current branch is the issue-linked branch for the resolved issue — its
name encodes the issue number per the `<issue>-<slug>` convention `new-branch`
produces.

- When it already matches, stay on it; do not run `new-branch`.
- Otherwise — including when the worktree starts on a non-default but
  non-issue-linked branch — run `new-branch` to establish the issue-linked
  branch.
- When a host-provided branch cannot or should not be renamed onto the
  issue-linked name, surface that deviation instead of forcing a switch.

End on the issue-linked branch.

### Self-assignment

- Read the issue's current assignees from its `assignees` field (for example
  `gh issue view <number> --json assignees`). Assign only when that list is
  empty.
- When the issue has zero assignees, assign it to the current
  `gh`-authenticated user with a single issue-level call,
  `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me`, run once. Resolve "myself" to
  `@me`; never hardcode a username, so the skill stays reusable across every
  consumer.
- When the issue already has one or more assignees — `@me` or anyone else — do
  nothing. Do not add `@me` as an additional assignee.
- This is one issue-level call, not a per-project-item operation.
- If the assignment call fails (permissions, missing write access, API error),
  skip and record the reason, then continue.

### GitHub Project status

- Inspect the issue's existing GitHub Projects through its GitHub Project items
  (the issue's `projectItems` data). For each existing GitHub Project item:
  - Use project-item inspection to find a compatible field where
    Status = `In progress` is offered as an exact option and update that project
    item to `In progress`.
  - Do not add the issue to projects. Do not create project fields or status
    options.
  - Skip incompatible project items and continue when the project lacks a
    compatible status field, lacks the `In progress` option, or project-item
    inspection or updates fail due to permissions.
- Record the project status update result and the self-assignment result,
  including each updated item and skipped item reason, for the caller's report.

## Do not touch the issue body

This skill aligns *mechanical* state only — branch, assignment, status. It never
edits the issue title or body. Requirement changes and scope divergence are the
controller's concern, not alignment.

## Final Report

Report for the caller:

- The resolved issue reference, URL, and title — or `no-issue` when none
  resolved, so the caller can warn and continue.
- Branch landed on, and whether `new-branch` ran.
- Self-assignment result only when it failed or created a human next action;
  stay silent on a successful assignment or one skipped because the issue was
  already assigned.
- Project status result only when it changed readiness, failed, or was skipped
  for a reason the caller needs.
- Any deviation that needs human attention, such as a host branch that could not
  be renamed onto the issue-linked name.
